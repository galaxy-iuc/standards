Galaxy Tool Development Standards and Best Practices
======================================================================

Following the extensive efforts put by the developers from the `Intergalactic Utilities Commission (IUC) <https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/IUC>`__ into
developing `Galaxy <https://galaxyproject.org/>`__ tools over the years, we have tried to come up with some best
practices. We recommend their use to the community of Galaxy tool developers, both
for contributing back to the
`IUC repository <https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/>`__ and for use in
their own tool repositories.

You can read these Best Practices at `readthedocs <http://galaxy-iuc-standards.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__ .
